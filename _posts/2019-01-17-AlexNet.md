The next in the series of networks that popularized Convolution Neural Networks and Deep Learning is the seminal AlexNet. 
In 2012 AlexNet won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). To quote from their Abstract 
> We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million
high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different
classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5%
and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The
neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists
of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers,
and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training
faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation
of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected
layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout”
that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the
ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%,
compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.
